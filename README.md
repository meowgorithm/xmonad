XMonad: The Meowgorithm Collector’s Edition
===========================================

[XMonad][xm] is the the ultimate yak-shave, but why stop there? To pump the yak
shaving to the max this configuration exists in its own repo to make so we can
make use of [Haskell Language Server][hls] in config development.

[hls]: https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server

***

This config is based largely on [Toby’s](https://github.com/toby) superior
XMonad and XMobar configs.
